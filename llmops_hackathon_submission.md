## Triton + Kubernetes for Recommendation Systems and Document Q&A with NVIDIA Blueprint

---

## Executive Summary

**Project Vision**: Revolutionize enterprise AI deployment by creating a unified LLMOps platform that seamlessly handles both recommendation systems and document Q&A across hybrid cloud environments.

**Core Innovation**: First-of-its-kind implementation combining NVIDIA's Triton Inference Server with Kubernetes orchestration to serve multiple AI use cases through a single, scalable infrastructure.

**Value Proposition**: Reduce AI deployment complexity by 70% while achieving sub-250ms inference latency and 92% recommendation precision.

## Problem Statement

### Critical Enterprise AI Challenges

**Infrastructure Complexity**
- Manual model lifecycle management across hybrid environments
- Inconsistent GPU resource utilization (30-40% typical utilization)
- Fragmented toolchains leading to operational silos

**Performance Bottlenecks**
- High latency for real-time recommendations (>1000ms typical)
- Poor scalability for concurrent document processing
- Lack of multi-model serving capabilities

**Business Impact**
- 60% of AI projects fail to reach production due to deployment complexity
- Enterprise teams spend 70% of time on infrastructure vs. innovation
- Average 6-month delay from model development to production deployment

**Market Gap**: No unified platform exists that can efficiently serve both structured (recommendations) and unstructured (document Q&A) AI workloads with enterprise-grade reliability.
